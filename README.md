# 🖥️ C++ Modular & Imperative Programming Module  

In this module, I used **C++** and an **imperative, modular approach** to solve problems efficiently.  

## 📌 Module Overview  

This module focused on **Imperative Programming**, a fundamental concept in computer science, and covered key topics such as:  

✅ **Problem Analysis & Program Construction**  
✅ **Editing, Compiling, Running, and Debugging**  
✅ **Fundamental Programming Elements**: Types, Control Structures, Arrays, Functions, and Libraries  
✅ **Introduction to Object-Oriented Concepts**  

## 📂 Topics Covered  

- **Programming Fundamentals**: Writing structured and efficient code  
- **Control Structures & Data Types**: Mastering loops, conditionals, and variables  
- **Functions & Libraries**: Reusing code for better modularity  
- **Basic Program Analysis**: Debugging and optimizing simple programs
